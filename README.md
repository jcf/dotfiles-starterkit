# Dotfiles StarterKit

An example `dotfiles` repo built on top of Ansible, which you'll want to install
via `pip`.

``` sh
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install ansible
```

If you want to use my [dotfiles][], you'll need to remove any mention of me
first. You can see where I am via a quick [GitHub code search][].
